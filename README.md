# Debt Transformation: Minimizing Edge Count in Bipartite Graphs

## Introduction
Debt transformation is a critical task in debt management and financial decision-making. This project proposes a novel approach that combines dynamic programming for smaller debt graphs and genetic algorithms for larger graphs to minimize the edge count effectively. The goal is to transform debt graphs into bipartite graphs with the least number of edges, enabling efficient debt management and informed financial decision-making.

## Approach

### Dynamic Programming for Smaller Debt Graphs
For smaller debt graphs, we employ dynamic programming techniques to determine the optimal transformation, ensuring the minimum number of edges in the resulting bipartite graph. By breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and utilizing previously computed solutions, we can efficiently find the optimal solution.

### Genetic Algorithms for Larger Debt Graphs
Dynamic programming approaches face limitations when applied to larger debt graphs due to their exponential time complexity. To address this challenge, we introduce genetic algorithms as a scalable optimization technique. Genetic algorithms simulate the process of natural selection, incorporating concepts like crossover, mutation, and selection to iteratively improve the edge count in transformed bipartite graphs.

### Genetic Algorithm Framework
Our genetic algorithm framework encompasses the following components:

1. Representation: We represent each gene as a permutation, which encodes the transformation of the debt graph into a bipartite graph.
2. Fitness Evaluation: The fitness evaluation mechanism calculates the number of edges in a specific solution, serving as a measure of the solution's quality.
3. Selection: We employ tournament selection to select individuals with higher fitness values, increasing the likelihood of selecting fitter solutions.
4. Crossover: Order crossover is used as the crossover operator, which combines genetic material from two parent solutions to create offspring solutions.
5. Mutation: Mutation introduces random changes in the genetic material of solutions, allowing for exploration of new regions in the solution space.
6. Termination: The algorithm terminates when a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum number of iterations or finding a solution with an acceptable edge count.

## Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of our proposed approach on a diverse set of debt graphs with varying sizes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of dynamic programming for smaller graphs, achieving optimal edge count. Additionally, our genetic algorithm approach outperforms other conventional optimization methods for larger graphs, significantly reducing the edge count compared to alternative techniques.

## Conclusion
This project offers a comprehensive solution for minimizing the edge count in the transformation of debt graphs into bipartite graphs. By combining dynamic programming and genetic algorithms, we achieve efficient and scalable optimization, enabling effective debt management and aiding financial decision-making processes. The proposed approach provides a valuable tool for organizations and individuals seeking to manage debts more efficiently and make informed financial decisions.
